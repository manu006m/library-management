Several companies, including Brabus, Renntech and Carlsson, have become car tuners (or modifiers) of Mercedes Benz models, in order to increase performance and/or luxury of a given model. AMG is Mercedes-Benz's in-house performance-tuning division, specialising in high-performance versions of most Mercedes-Benz cars. AMG engines are all hand-built,[140] and each completed engine receives a tag with the signature of the engineer who built it. AMG has been wholly owned by Mercedes-Benz since 1999.[141] The 2009 SLS AMG, a revival of the 300SL Gullwing, is the first car to be entirely developed by AMG.

Sponsorships
<div class="d1">manu</div>
Mercedes-Benz sponsors the Germany national football team.
In football (soccer), Mercedes-Benz sponsored the Germany national team until 2018. Mercedes-Benz sponsors Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart and provided until June 2023 the naming rights for their stadium, the former Mercedes-Benz Arena.[142] The company formerly held a ten-year naming rights contract to the Caesars Superdome, an American football stadium in New Orleans, from 2011 to 2021.[143] On 24 August 2015, Mercedes-Benz was announced as the naming rights sponsor for the Atlanta Falcons' new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, (Mercedes-Benz's US headquarters are in Greater Atlanta) which opened in August 2017.[144]

Mercedes-Benz worked with English magician Steven Frayne, also known as Dynamo, to create a video called Dynamo vs Coulthard.[145] Formula One driver David Coulthard drove Dynamo around a track at race-speed in a Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG, before Dynamo successfully drove around the same track in the same car whilst blindfolded and surrounded by pyrotechnics.[146] The stunt was part of the finale for Series 3 of Dynamo: Magician Impossible, screened on UK television channel Watch.

Several companies, including Brabus, Renntech and Carlsson, have become car tuners (or modifiers) of Mercedes Benz models, in order to increase performance and/or luxury of a given model. AMG is Mercedes-Benz's in-house performance-tuning division, specialising in high-performance versions of most Mercedes-Benz cars. AMG engines are all hand-built,[140] and each completed engine receives a tag with the signature of the engineer who built it. AMG has been wholly owned by Mercedes-Benz since 1999.[141] The 2009 SLS AMG, a revival of the 300SL Gullwing, is the first car to be entirely developed by AMG.

In football (soccer), Mercedes-Benz sponsored the Germany national team until 2018. Mercedes-Benz sponsors Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart and provided until June 2023 the naming rights for their stadium, the former Mercedes-Benz Arena.[142] The company formerly held a ten-year naming rights contract to the Caesars Superdome, an American football stadium in New Orleans, from 2011 to 2021.[143] On 24 August 2015, Mercedes-Benz was announced as the naming rights sponsor for the Atlanta Falcons' new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, (Mercedes-Benz's US headquarters are in Greater Atlanta) which opened in August 2017.[144]

Mercedes-Benz worked with English magician Steven Frayne, also known as Dynamo, to create a video called Dynamo vs Coulthard.[145] Formula One driver David Coulthard drove Dynamo around a track at race-speed in a Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG, before Dynamo successfully drove around the same track in the same car whilst blindfolded and surrounded by pyrotechnics.[146] The stunt was part of the finale for Series 3 of Dynamo: Magician Impossible, screened on UK television channel Watch.Tuners

Several companies, including Brabus, Renntech and Carlsson, have become car tuners (or modifiers) of Mercedes Benz models, in order to increase performance and/or luxury of a given model. AMG is Mercedes-Benz's in-house performance-tuning division, specialising in high-performance versions of most Mercedes-Benz cars. AMG engines are all hand-built,[140] and each completed engine receives a tag with the signature of the engineer who built it. AMG has been wholly owned by Mercedes-Benz since 1999.[141] The 2009 SLS AMG, a revival of the 300SL Gullwing, is the first car to be entirely developed by AMG.

Sponsorships

Mercedes-Benz sponsors the Germany national football team.
In football (soccer), Mercedes-Benz sponsored the Germany national team until 2018. Mercedes-Benz sponsors Bundesliga club VfB Stuttgart and provided until June 2023 the naming rights for their stadium, the former Mercedes-Benz Arena.[142] The company formerly held a ten-year naming rights contract to the Caesars Superdome, an American football stadium in New Orleans, from 2011 to 2021.[143] On 24 August 2015, Mercedes-Benz was announced as the naming rights sponsor for the Atlanta Falcons' new home, Mercedes-Benz Stadium, (Mercedes-Benz's US headquarters are in Greater Atlanta) which opened in August 2017.[144]

Mercedes-Benz worked with English magician Steven Frayne, also known as Dynamo, to create a video called Dynamo vs Coulthard.[145] Formula One driver David Coulthard drove Dynamo around a track at race-speed in a Mercedes-Benz SL63 AMG, before Dynamo successfully drove around the same track in the same car whilst blindfolded and surrounded by pyrotechnics.[146] The stunt was part of the finale for Series 3 of Dynamo: Magician Impossible, screened on UK television channel Watch.Tuners
